## 🔍 About Skyla

**Skyla** is a modern cybersecurity framework focused on securing code at its **most vulnerable layer** — the source. With integrated AI capabilities, advanced runtime protection, and proprietary mechanisms like **CodeVault**, Skyla empowers developers and security professionals to **protect, test, and execute** code securely — even in untrusted environments.

> “Built not to look secure. Built to be secure.”

## 🧬 Philosophy

Skyla was created with a simple principle:

> **If you understand how attackers think, you can build what defenders dream.**

This project isn't just about protecting code — it’s about understanding the **entire lifecycle of vulnerability**, then **defeating it at every stage**.
