# üöÄ Skyla ‚Äî Feature Deep Dive

Skyla brings together hardened security engineering and AI-driven intelligence to deliver a secure-by-design framework for executing and protecting sensitive codebases.

> Skyla does more than secure code ‚Äî it builds confidence into the foundation of your execution layer.

## üîê CodeVault ‚Äî Source Defense Engine

**Purpose:** To protect your most critical source logic from being exposed or reversed, while allowing it to execute normally.

### Core Features:
- Multi-stage encryption & obfuscation
- Fileless runtime execution (in-memory only)
- Launch restricted by hash-verified token
- Runtime environment locks (based on device, network, or context)
- Automatic invalidation on tampering detection

> _Think of it as a vault. But instead of storing secrets, it stores logic ‚Äî safely executed, never revealed._

## ü§ñ AI-Powered Analysis

### Static Analysis:
- Scans source code before execution for logic flaws, misconfigurations, or vulnerabilities
- NLP-based understanding of dev logic patterns
- Integration with known CVE databases and signature matching

### Dynamic Analysis:
- Monitors execution traces in a sandboxed mode
- Learns behavioral deviations and anomalies
- Offers code-hardening recommendations

## ‚öîÔ∏è Autopwn Engine

> Simulated attacker logic built into the framework.

- Internal red-teaming simulation layer
- Attempts real-world privilege escalation and bypass attacks (sandboxed)
- Reports potential weaknesses without ever exposing logic externally

### Modules:
- Privilege Escalation Testers
- Input Sanitization Checker
- Network Exposure Scan
- Payload Execution Resistance (PER) Stress Tests

## üõ°Ô∏è Runtime Security Stack

- **AES-GCM** encrypted code blobs
- **SHA256** and **HMAC** integrity verification
- **ZKP** (Zero-Knowledge Proofs) for environment auth
- **Anti-debugging logic** (stack tampering, hardware checks)
- **Memory zeroization** post-execution

---

## üìÅ System Protection

- Full encryption key rotation every run
- Machine ID & IP-bound session execution
- Delayed-time trap logic (if execution is monitored or interrupted)
- Encrypted logs with dual-mode unlock (admin + system hash)

---

## üß™ Dev Tools (Internal Use / Optional Release)

- CLI interface for hash validation
- Live log tracer (in Tauri GUI or CLI)
- Code fingerprint generator
- Secure executor: trigger from safe environment with integrity challenge
