## 🔐 Core Highlights

- **CodeVault**  
  A deeply hardened source code protection mechanism. CodeVault ensures that your most sensitive logic stays inaccessible, unreadable, and uncompromised — even in hostile environments.

- **AI-Powered Analysis**  
  Skyla integrates custom AI models to **scan, detect, and interpret vulnerabilities** in codebases, offering smart remediation suggestions and detailed risk analysis.

- **Autopwn Logic**  
  A controlled offensive simulation engine that safely replicates real-world attack vectors to evaluate the resilience of your code and infrastructure.

- **Zero-Knowledge Execution**  
  Execute sensitive code without ever exposing it to the runtime — Skyla deploys fileless execution methods combined with cryptographic integrity checks.

## 🧬 Philosophy

Skyla isn't just another security tool.  
It's a concept. A mindset.  
Built to **defend against what's possible**, not just what's known.
