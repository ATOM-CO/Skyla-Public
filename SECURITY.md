# 🔐 Skyla — Security Philosophy & Practices

Skyla is developed with the mindset of defending against adversaries that **think like attackers** — not just signatures, but strategy.

---

## 🧠 Threat Model

Skyla assumes:
- The execution environment may be monitored
- The user’s OS may be compromised
- Network channels can be intercepted
- Reverse engineering is always attempted

Thus, Skyla does not simply **run securely** — it validates its context, locks itself down, and protects the logic **before, during, and after** runtime.

---

## 🔒 Secure Execution Principles

1. **Code should never be readable.**  
   Skyla uses advanced encryption, ZKP auth, and runtime memory controls to guarantee that.

2. **If the environment isn’t trusted, execution is denied.**  
   Skyla checks for system hash integrity, launch parameters, and anomalies.

3. **Execution ≠ Exposure.**  
   Even during execution, logic is not decrypted in full or stored in memory plainly.

## 🧩 AI & CVE Handling

- All AI-based scanning is done locally.
- CVE intelligence and matching operate from a **local snapshot DB** updated via secured channels.
- No code is sent remotely — all processing happens within the protected system.

---

## 🧿 Integrity Check Layers

- **Hash Check** — Source fingerprint is verified before use  
- **Execution Token** — Session-specific key required to decrypt code  
- **Runtime Anomaly Detection** — Alerts if signs of debugging, virtualization, or injection are found

---

## 🧼 Memory Hygiene

- Zeroed buffers after execution
- Volatile memory access only for decrypted payloads
- Stack obfuscation to confuse memory dumps

## 💭 Developer Note

> “If I was trying to break this, what would I do?”

That question is asked every time a new feature is built. Skyla is not designed to appear secure. It’s designed to be secure — even under scrutiny.
